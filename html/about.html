        <h2>Welcome to my world...</h2>
        <p>I believe medicine and technology share a common mission: improving lives through knowledge and innovation. My journey brings these two worlds together.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I was fascinated by how things workâ€”whether inside the human body or within computer systems.
           As a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery student, I have developed a keen eye for detail, strong analytical skills, and a disciplined approach to problem-solving. <br>
           I advanced this curiosity by completing a short course in software development, gaining practical experience in full-stack web development, and product design.</p>
           <p>These combined experiences drive my passion for med-tech innovation.
            My goal is to leverage my medical training and technical expertise to build scalable digital health solutions that enhance education, improve patient care, and expand access to healthcare resources</p>
